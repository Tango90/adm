To solve this problem, we need to optimize the delivery of orders from the warehouse in Cincinnati, OH, using the available trucks and drivers. The goal is to minimize the overall cost, which includes factors like driver salaries, fuel consumption, and truck capacity utilization.


**Understanding the Data**


**1.	item_info.csv:**
 
Contains details about items, including:

    o	ItemId: Unique identifier for each item.
    
    o	weight (pounds): Weight of each item.
    
    o	warehouse origin: All items originate from Cincinnati, OH.


**2.	orders.csv:**


Contains details about orders, including:

    o	Company: The customer.
    
    o	Item: The item ID.
    
    o	Number of Units: The quantity of the item ordered.
    
    o	Destination: The city and state for delivery.
    
    o	There are two unnamed columns that appear to be empty.


**3.	trucks.xlsx (Sheet1):**


Contains details about available trucks and drivers:

    o	Truck ID: Unique truck identifier.
    
    o	Driver Name: Assigned driver.
    
    o	Years Experience: Experience level of the driver.
    
    o	Truck Type (length in m): The truck size.
    
    o	Weight Capacity (kg): The maximum weight capacity.
    
    o	Top Speed (km/h): The truck’s speed.
    
    o	Driver Hourly Rate: The cost per hour for the driver.
    
    o	Fuel Tank Size (gallon): The fuel tank capacity.
    
    o	Spare Tires: Number of spare tires available.
    
    o	Truck Age (years): The age of the truck.


**Next Steps**


**1.	Optimization Approach:**
   
     o	Assign orders to trucks based on weight capacity.
     
     o	Group orders by location to minimize route costs.
     
     o	Plan truck routes to visit multiple locations efficiently.
     
     o	Consider driver working limits (14-hour shifts, 10-hour breaks).
     
     o	Minimize fuel and labour costs.


**2.	Python Implementation:**

   
     o	API to accept orders and return optimized delivery plans.
     
     o	Route optimization using Google OR-Tools or Graph Algorithms.
     
     o	Cost estimation based on fuel and driver wages.

     o	Docker for containerized deployment.


**4.	Infrastructure Configuration:**

     
     o	YAML file for Azure services.
     
     o	Dockerfile for containerized API deployment.


**Assumptions**

  
    •	All trucks start and end their journey at the Cincinnati warehouse.
    
    •	Fuel consumption is directly proportional to distance travelled.
    
    •	Driver costs are based on the time taken to complete the route.
    
    •	The road network and distances between cities are known and can be used for route planning.


**Now, I'll implement the Python script for route optimization and API deployment.**

        from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
        import pandas as pd
        import networkx as nx
        
        # Load Data
        item_info = pd.read_csv(r"data\item_info.csv")
        orders = pd.read_csv(r"data\orders.csv")
        trucks = pd.read_excel(r"data\trucks.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
        
        
        # Initialize Flask App
        app = Flask(__name__)
        
        # Build Graph for Route Optimization
        G = nx.Graph()
        
        # Placeholder: Add nodes (cities) and edges (distances between them)
        # In a real-world case, we'd use an API like Google Maps to get distances
        
        # API Endpoint for Delivery Optimization
        @app.route("/optimize_routes", methods=["POST"])
        def optimize_routes():
            data = request.get_json()
            orders = data.get("orders", [])
        
            optimized_routes = []
            for order in orders:
                destination = order["Destination"]
                weight = int(order["Number of Units"]) * int(item_info[item_info["ItemId"] == order["Item"]]["weight (pounds)"].values[0])  # Convert to int
                truck = trucks.loc[trucks["Weight Capacity (kg)"] >= weight].iloc[0]
                
                optimized_routes.append({
                    "Truck ID": int(truck["Truck ID"]),  # Convert int64 to int
                    "Destination": destination,
                    "Weight": int(weight)  # Convert int64 to int
                })
            
            return jsonify({"optimized_routes": optimized_routes})
        
        
        # Run API
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run(debug=True)

========================================================================================================================================================================


Building the above scenario in an Azure environment involves leveraging various Azure services to create a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution. Below is a step-by-step guide to implementing the delivery optimization scenario using Azure services:



**Step 1: Data Storage and Preparation**


**Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) or Azure Blob Storage:**



    Store the input files (trucks.xlsx, item_info.csv, and orders.csv) in Azure Blob Storage or ADLS for centralized data storage.
        
    Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest and preprocess the data (e.g., converting weights from pounds to kilograms).



**Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB:**



    Load the processed data into an Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB for structured querying and analysis.
    
    Use SQL queries to join tables (e.g., orders with item_info) and prepare the dataset for optimization.

    

**Step 2: Optimization Logic**



**Azure Functions:**



Write the optimization logic (e.g., assigning orders to trucks, calculating distances, and minimizing costs) as an Azure Function.

Use Python or C# to implement the logic, leveraging libraries like geopy for distance calculations and pandas for data manipulation.



**Azure Logic Apps:**



Orchestrate the workflow using Azure Logic Apps to trigger the optimization function when new data is uploaded to Blob Storage.



**Step 3: Route Planning**



**Azure Maps API:**



Use Azure Maps API to calculate accurate distances and routes between the warehouse and destination cities.

Integrate the API into the Azure Function to optimize delivery routes.




**Azure Machine Learning (Optional):**



If advanced optimization techniques (e.g., Genetic Algorithms or Reinforcement Learning) are required, use Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy models.


**Step 4: Visualization and Reporting**



**Power BI:**



Connect Power BI to Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB to visualize the optimized delivery routes, truck assignments, and cost breakdowns.

Create dashboards for real-time monitoring of delivery operations.



**Azure Synapse Analytics:**



Use Synapse Analytics for large-scale data processing and analytics, combining data from multiple sources for deeper insights.



**Step 5: Deployment and Automation**


**Azure DevOps:**



Use Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines to deploy the Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and other components.

Automate testing and deployment processes.




**Azure Monitor:**



Set up monitoring and alerts using Azure Monitor to track the performance of the optimization logic and Azure services.



**Step 6: Cost Management**


**Azure Cost Management:**



Use Azure Cost Management to monitor and optimize the costs of running the solution.

Set budgets and alerts to avoid unexpected expenses.

                      import pandas as pd
                      from geopy.distance import geodesic
                      
                      def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
                          logging.info('Optimization function triggered.')
                      
                          # Load data from Azure SQL Database
                          orders_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM Orders", connection_string)
                          items_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM Items", connection_string)
                          trucks_df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM Trucks", connection_string)
                      
                          # Merge data
                          orders_df = pd.merge(orders_df, items_df, left_on='Item', right_on='ItemId')
                      
                          # Convert weight to kg
                          orders_df['weight (kg)'] = orders_df['weight (pounds)'] * 0.453592
                      
                          # Assign orders to trucks
                          assignments = assign_orders_to_trucks(orders_df, trucks_df)
                      
                          # Calculate total cost
                          total_cost = calculate_total_cost(assignments, trucks_df)
                      
                          return func.HttpResponse(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:.2f}", status_code=200)

                             from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
                             
                             credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
                             maps_client = MapsRouteClient(credential=credential)
                             
                             def calculate_distance(origin, destination):
                                 route = maps_client.get_route_directions(
                                     route_points=[origin, destination],
                                     travel_mode="truck"
                                 )
                                 return route.routes[0].summary.length_in_meters / 1000  # Convert to km
